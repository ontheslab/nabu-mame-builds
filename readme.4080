--Emulator for the NABU PC - 4080 Test Linux sub system--

This is a compilation of files to add full support for Linux to the Windows x64 build of MAME by GTAMP. The NABU core coded by brijohn.

The base and configuration files are taken from GTAMP's Windows release, additional files that have been added and the scripts replaced.

My ultimate goal is a relocatable "AppImage" for Linux - presently targeted at the Steam Deck.

Getting Started - How to use:
-----------------------------

Download and run a NABU Internet Adapter “app” of your choice (example from https://gtamp.com/nabu/)
Start the “TCP” in your NABU Internet Adapter app
Run boot-external-adapter.sh to connect to external NABU Internet Adapter

Binary included (in this package):

mame4080
 - Test Version with "dual" NABU Cores
 - Standard version using the TMS9918A video chip (40 Column) "nanbupc".
 - Enhanced version using the V9938 video chip (80 Column) "nabupc80".

Command Line options now include:

 - nabupc - stock 40col NABU Emulation
 - nabupc80 - enhanced 80col NABU Emulation

Example: ./mame4080 nabupc80 -window -hcca null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:5816

Will try to connect to a "local" NABU Internet Adapter running on the same machine in 80col mode.

Description of the included scripts (bash):

(These first scripts are the same as the Windows release for consistency)

boot-3.5-floppy-image.sh
 - I don't have an image to include, so ignore this one ("nabupc" 40Col)
boot-5.25-floppy-image.sh
 - push 2 for floppy disk and it boots CPM ("nabupc" 40Col)
boot-built-in-adapter-local.sh
 - uses the built-in network adapter to run breakout.npz ("nabupc" 40Col) 
boot-built-in-adapter-remote.sh
 - uses the built-in network adapter to run nabu.ca cycle ("nabupc" 40Col)
boot-external-adapter.sh
 - tries to connect to an external network adapter on 127.0.0.1:5816 ("nabupc80" 80Col)

(My sample scripts)

runnabu-floppy.sh
 - Loads Floppy enabled rom (rev14) along with the internal (Internet Adapter) - push 2 for floppy disk and it boots CPM, 1 and it boots from using the internal adapter and loads "nabu.ca - cycle 1" (cycles 1 to 3 are selectable from the MAME “tab” menu ("nabupc" 40Col). 

runnabu-external.sh
 - tries to connect to an external network adapter on 192.168.0.211:5816 (in this example, the IP address of my Pi server) ("nabupc80" 80Col).



Default controls:

||> = Page Down
<||| = Page Up
Yes = F1
No = F2
TV = F3
SYM = F4

You can restart most apps by holding SYM (F4) AND the += key

All other functions are as stated in GTAMP’s readme.gtamp (read.me)file.

General notes on running under Linux:

These Builds are based on MAME v250 that has been updated (by brijohn) with full NABU Pc Support.

Generally speaking most “modern” Linux distributions will include the required libraries – such as SDL2, QT5 and glibc.

Most common error: The distributions of Linux vary greatly, as stated above - SDL2 is installed on most distributions, however its optional font support is often NOT installed.

You may get an error like this: "error while loading shared libraries: libSDL2_ttf-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

The SDL2 True Type Font library just needs to be installed - Ubuntu/Mint example: sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0  

Thank you, I hope this helps get more Linux users up and running in an easy manner.

Additional binaries have been compiled for the following systems and can be downloaded separately – they can be used to replace the included “x86 Linux” binaries.

mame-arm32.zip – 32bit Raspberry Pi binaries.
mame-arm64.zip – 64bit Raspberry Pi binaries.
mame-linux86.zip – x86-64bit Linux binaries (included in the standard Linux archive).
mame-macx86.zip – MacOSX (Intel 64bit) binaries.

These builds (compiled) by “Intangybles” - https://github.com/ontheslab/nabu-mame-builds - Please excuse this rough and ready document.

Lets call this Version 1.0.2a

Please see “readme.gtamp” for change log.
